Need help on an android app to fix the diabetes app 

My kid who's atm 2 years old has diabetes i'm using an app called Helpdiabetes worked fine on android 6 but got updated to android 7.

The app crash and the one who made the app is away, the one who in control of the app don't know how to fix the issue so need help to fix it.

Could someone please have a look at the app and try to fix it. 

It gives us the possibility to add food in it and then i know how much insuline i need to give to her.

Please help :)
